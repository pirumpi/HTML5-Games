HTML5 Games
------------

I created this projects to explore the different javascript engines available today to develop games using just HTML5 technologies. There are any options online so this is my TODO app but using a Shooting game instead. I always welcome suggestions and comments on how to improve each versions of the games.

##Running the games

**Before you are able to test the different versions of the shooter games you must install node or set the public folder in a web server such as Apache or IIS. The easies way to run it is just installing node.**

```js
  git clone https://github.com/pirumpi/HTML5-Games.git
  npm install
  npm start
```
